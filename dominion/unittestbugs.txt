FAILED ASSERTION: I should be allowed to play with a lot of people!
FAILED ASSERTION: Score Should be 11
FAILED ASSERTION: Score Should be 19
FAILED ASSERTION: Village should give 2 more actions
FAILED ASSERTION: great_hall should give 1 more action
FAILED ASSERTION: Smithy should not give you an action
FAILED ASSERTION: Adventurer should give you 2 cards
FAILED ASSERTION: Adventurer should not give you an action
FAILED ASSERTION: Adventurer should give you two treasure cards

The first bug I have found include the scoring of victory cards
Another commonly repeating bug is that the number of remaining actions is not being incremented properly
I also found that Adventurer did not exhibit any of the proper behavior that would be expected from it
